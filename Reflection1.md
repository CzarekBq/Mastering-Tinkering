- Tinkering is widely associated with 'trial and error'. Where do definitions coincide and where do they differ?

*work in progress*

- Can you take a typical I-Tech (or your own study domain) related project case and list 5 technical hurdles? to which extent do they allow for a 'playful' approach in tackling them?


1. Problems with designing a controller: a lot of it is just applying text book knowledge but often times I also need to do some coding tinkering by changing variable values, rearranging the block diagram a bit and see what happens etc.

- Where would you go hunting for tinkerspiration? List 5 physical and 5 online resources valuable for an I-Tech specialist

I am not doing I-tech but in for my Robotics field I would say:

Physical

1. car repair workshop
2. tinkering kits (like lego, or electronics kits)
3. 

Online

1. 
*work in progress*

- List 5 domains, challenges or settings in which you would like to apply tinkering. Can you identify some sweet spots, (perhaps beyond the well-known such as STEM education) and can you also define some limitations? Are there 'untinkerable' domains?
