# ABOUT ME


Hello and welcome to my portfolio :)

My name is Cezary. Its diminutive in Polish is Czarek ("Cha-rek") which I usually go by (to the confusion of my international friends). I did my Bachelor's at University of Twente called ATLAS as well as a premaster in Robotics. Currently I am pursuing my Master's degree in Robotics at the same University. My hobbies include cycling, general topic of repairs (bikes, phones, laptops, electronics in general, scooters, furniture, clothes) and digital/hand-drawn/3D art.


## Workstation

![workstation](https://github.com/CzarekBq/Mastering-Tinkering/assets/90681144/f7a2a2e7-2dc6-45e8-9faf-06480f480d4c)

This is my portable workstation. If there is anything more specific I need to do physically then I visit DesignLab. For most of my projects this workstation is good for at least 90-100% of the creation process. The three points that stimulate tinkering are:

- **My laptop; An old one but gets the job done! All of my sotware tools are there. It is also a good inspiration medium (aka for using the internet)**
- **Graphic tablet; a mouse can get me only so far, it allows me to translate what I want to draw/sketch into the digital world (also nice to play with)** 
- **My pencil case; in there I do not only keep drawing/sketching supplies but also all sorts of cables, DesignLab badge and little trinkets**
- **Bonus: water bottle; you can't go wrong with that**

Add a page about you, your previous study/studies, relevant hobbies and, importantly
make a picture of your workspace and circle / highlight 3 points that stimulate tinkering. Also, list three things that might improve tinkerability. (check if there is privacy-sensitive information, then don't show it or make a drawing or use an alternative picture)
submit the link to your site before the next class
