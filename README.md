# ABOUT ME


Hello and welcome to my portfolio :)

My name is Cezary. Its diminutive in Polish is Czarek ("Cha-rek") which I usually go by (to the confusion of my international friends). I did my Bachelor's at University of Twente called ATLAS as well as a premaster in Robotics. Currently I am pursuing my Master's degree in Robotics at the same University. My hobbies include cycling, general topic of repairs (bikes, phones, laptops, electronics in general, scooters, furniture, clothes) and digital/hand-drawn/3D art.



Add a page about you, your previous study/studies, relevant hobbies and, importantly
make a picture of your workspace and circle / highlight 3 points that stimulate tinkering. Also, list three things that might improve tinkerability. (check if there is privacy-sensitive information, then don't show it or make a drawing or use an alternative picture)
submit the link to your site before the next class
